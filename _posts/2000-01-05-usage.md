# Starting Up FlyBrainLab

After the installation, simply run
```bash
jupyter lab
```
to get started.

To test if your installations are working, check
* whether you see an "FFBO" section below "Other" in JupyterLab Launcher, as shown here:

</p>

* whether you can run the example notebook [here](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FBLClient/blob/master/examples/jupyter_notebooks/1_introduction.ipynb).

### Documentation

Documentation for FBLClient, which handles communications between FBL and an FFBO server, is available [here](https://flybrainlab.github.io/FBLClient/_build/site/flybrainlab/flybrainlab-main/).
