## Installation

### Quick Installation

#### Linux/macOS

First, make sure that you have an installation of Anaconda or miniconda. Anaconda can be installed from https://www.anaconda.com/ and miniconda is available at https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. We recommend Anaconda. Secondly, download fbl_installer.sh from this repository (link above). Then, open up your terminal or command line, go to an empty directory in which you want your FlyBrainLab installation to reside and enter the following line by line:

```bash
conda create -n flybrainlab python=3.7 -y
source activate flybrainlab
```

You can change "flybrainlab" to a different name of your choice. Then, on macOS, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_mac.sh
```

on Linux, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_ubuntu.sh
```

Linux installation was only tested on Ubuntu, but should work with the other operating systems.
