## Installation

### Quick Installation

#### Linux/macOS

First, make sure that you have an installation of Anaconda or miniconda. Anaconda can be installed from [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) and miniconda is available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</a>. We recommend Anaconda. Secondly, download fbl_installer.sh from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab">this repository</a>. Then, open up your terminal or command line, go to an empty directory in which you want your FlyBrainLab installation to reside and enter the following line by line:

```bash
conda create -n flybrainlab python=3.7 -y
```
```bash
source activate flybrainlab
```

You can change "flybrainlab" to a different name of your choice. Then, on macOS, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_mac.sh
```

on Linux, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_ubuntu.sh
