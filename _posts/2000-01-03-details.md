Installation instructions for FlyBrainLab are available [on the main repository](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab). These instructions are also detailed below. Additionally, we provide a Docker image and instructions for installing FlyBrainLab [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fruitflybrain/fbl).

## Installation

### Quick Installation

#### Linux/macOS

First, make sure that you have an installation of Anaconda or miniconda. Anaconda can be installed from [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) and miniconda is available at [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). We recommend Anaconda. Secondly, download fbl_installer.sh from [this repository](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab). Then, open up your terminal or command line, go to an empty directory in which you want your FlyBrainLab installation to reside and enter the following line by line:

```bash
conda create -n flybrainlab python=3.7 -y
source activate flybrainlab
```

You can change "flybrainlab" to a different name of your choice. Then, on macOS, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_mac.sh
```

on Linux, run:

```bash
sh fbl_installer_ubuntu.sh

Linux installation was only tested on Ubuntu, but should work with the other operating systems.
